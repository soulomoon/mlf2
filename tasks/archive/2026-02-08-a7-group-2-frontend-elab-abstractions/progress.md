- Dispatched Task 3 implementer subagent with full task context and TDD requirement.
- Task 3 completed and committed: `9a61519cfdeb24e2faeafc5d8b86709f2964ae8c`.
- Ran Task 3 spec-compliance reviewer: approved.
- Ran Task 3 code-quality reviewer: approved, no blocking issues.
- Batch 1 complete (Tasks 1-3); preparing checkpoint report for user feedback.
- Delivered checkpoint report to user and received continue signal.
- Next: execute Batch 2 Task 4 (verification + docs) with subagent + two-stage review.
- Dispatched Task 4 implementer subagent with full task context.
- Task 4 completed and committed: `305fc4435afc977aa03c72309951ba2562e847ea`.
- Ran Task 4 spec-compliance reviewer: approved.
- Ran Task 4 code-quality reviewer: approved, no blocking issues.
- All implementation-plan tasks complete; proceeding to finishing-a-development-branch workflow.
- Ran final completion verification: `cabal test` (PASS, 576 examples, 0 failures).
- Determined integration base branch via merge-base: `master`.
- Next: present completion options to user and execute selected branch-integration workflow.
- User requested follow-up implementation before integration.
- Follow-up scope set: (1) ensure the Pipeline regression test explicitly exercises `canonicalizeAnn`; (2) fix ineffective targeted verification command in the implementation plan.
- Updated `docs/plans/2026-02-08-a7-group-2-frontend-elab-abstractions-implementation-plan.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` per follow-up requirements, then reran the rewrite regression command (`cabal test mlf2-test --test-show-details=direct --test-option=-m --test-option='rewrite every node occurrence consistently'`).
- Adjusted the targeted command to run Pipeline/Phase 1/Phase 6 checks (multiple `--test-option`s) and verified it covers 173 examples before rerunning `cabal test` (576 examples total).
- Spec reviewer flagged first follow-up pass for not directly using production `canonicalizeAnn`; dispatched implementer fix.
- Implementer exported/re-exported `canonicalizeAnn` via `MLF.Elab.Run` and `MLF.Elab.Pipeline`, then updated `PipelineSpec` to call the production helper directly.
- Final follow-up commit: `3cd21903c782f40ffe5c27c9b72da9f9f849ad28`.
- Re-ran spec compliance review: approved.
- Ran code quality review: approved, no blocking issues.
- Integrated branch into `master` with merge commit `f762560` (non-fast-forward because branches diverged).
- Resolved merge conflicts in `CHANGELOG.md` and `implementation_notes.md` by preserving both Group 1 and Group 2 documentation updates.
- Fixed post-merge compile break in `test/PipelineSpec.hs` (restored `runPipelineWithPresolution` helper) in commit `e4a256f`, then reran `cabal test` on `master` successfully.
- Marked plan Phase 7 complete and archived this task folder to `tasks/archive/2026-02-08-a7-group-2-frontend-elab-abstractions`.
