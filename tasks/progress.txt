## Codebase Patterns

- **Module Import Cycles**: Ops.hs imports Base.hs, so Base cannot import Ops. Implement typeclass methods directly in Base.hs using local definitions.
- **Typeclass Method Naming**: When adding methods to MonadPresolution that conflict with Ops functions, remove imports from Ops in consuming modules and use the typeclass methods directly.
- **Lift Removal**: After adding methods to MonadPresolution, remove `lift $` calls before those methods in EdgeUnifyM since they now come from the typeclass instance.

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- Extended MonadPresolution typeclass with getNode and getCanonicalNode operations
- Implemented methods in PresolutionM instance using local findRoot and node lookup
- Implemented methods in EdgeUnifyM instance via liftPresolution
- Removed getNode and getCanonicalNode imports from Ops in EdgeUnify.hs
- Removed `lift $` calls before getNode/getCanonicalNode in EdgeUnify.hs (5 occurrences)
- Removed getNode and getCanonicalNode imports from Ops in EdgeProcessing.hs
- All tests pass

**Files changed:**
- src/MLF/Constraint/Presolution/Base.hs: Added getNode and getCanonicalNode to MonadPresolution typeclass, implemented findRoot and instance methods
- src/MLF/Constraint/Presolution/EdgeUnify.hs: Removed Ops imports, removed lift $ calls
- src/MLF/Constraint/Presolution/EdgeProcessing.hs: Removed Ops imports

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When adding typeclass methods that conflict with existing functions in other modules, need to remove imports from those modules
- The Ops module imports Base, so Base cannot import Ops - must implement methods directly
- EdgeUnifyM already has MonadPresolution instance, so just need to add the new methods to the instance
- Removing `lift $` calls is straightforward once the typeclass methods are available
