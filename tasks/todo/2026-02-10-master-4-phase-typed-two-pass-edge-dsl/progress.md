# Progress Log — Master 4-Phase Typed Two-Pass Edge DSL

## 2026-02-10

### Session initialization

- Confirmed desired direction via brainstorming:
  - High-change refactor allowed.
  - Primary metric: stronger type-guided architecture.
  - Rollout mode: phased.
  - Phase 1 focus: typed edge-processing DSL.
  - Explicit policy: strict paper-shaped representation (`TyExp-left` residual inst edges) and Phase-4 fail-fast assertion.

### Planning artifacts created

- Added master implementation plan:
  - `/Users/ares/.config/superpowers/worktrees/mlf4/codex/2026-02-09-new-worktree/docs/plans/2026-02-10-master-4-phase-typed-two-pass-edge-dsl-implementation-plan.md`

- Added task tracking folder and files:
  - `tasks/todo/2026-02-10-master-4-phase-typed-two-pass-edge-dsl/task_plan.md`
  - `tasks/todo/2026-02-10-master-4-phase-typed-two-pass-edge-dsl/findings.md`
  - `tasks/todo/2026-02-10-master-4-phase-typed-two-pass-edge-dsl/progress.md`

### Next step

- Start execution in a separate session using `@superpowers:executing-plans` against the master 4-phase plan.
