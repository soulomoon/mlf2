{- Note [binding-parent projection — ga′ invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The generalization pipeline (Phases 2–3) and `resolveContext` must preserve
the thesis ga′ (Def. 15.3.2) through the base↔solved mapping.

Phase 2 (`buildNodeMappings`, Generalize/Phase2.hs):
  `chooseMapping` prefers named base nodes that still exist in solved, falls
  back to `adoptRef` (redirect+UF).  The `solvedToBase` map inserts both
  canonical and raw keys (lines 110-113) using `keepOld` — first-inserted
  wins.  Risk: if a redirect merges two base nodes with different gen
  ancestors, the first-inserted mapping wins.  In practice this is safe
  because redirects only merge structurally equivalent nodes (TyExp
  elimination), which share the same gen ancestor.

Phase 3 (`computeBindParentsBase`, Generalize/Phase3.hs):
  Merges base binding parents (via `insertBindParentBase` with KeepOld) then
  overlays solved parents (via `insertBindParentSolved`).  Base-domain
  structure takes priority.  Solved parents only fill gaps or override
  self-parents/copies.  The `isUpperRef` check (line 94) rejects parents
  that are not structurally above the child in the solved constraint.  This
  is safe: if a valid base parent is rejected, the base-domain KeepOld
  insertion already captured it.

`quotientBindParentsUnder` (Binding/Canonicalization.hs):
  Drops self-edges, merges duplicates by keeping the first parent and taking
  max flag.  "Keep first parent" (lines 92-94) is deterministic.  When UF
  merges nodes from different gen scopes, the first parent seen may not be
  the thesis-correct one.  However, this only applies to the solved-domain
  quotient; the base-domain binding parents (which define ga′) are computed
  separately in Phase 3 and are not subject to this quotient.

`resolveContext` (Presolution/Plan/Context.hs):
  `resolveScopeRoot` maps solved TypeRef through `gaSolvedToBase`, then runs
  `bindingPathToRootLocal` on base binding parents to find the gen ancestor.
  This is the authoritative ga′ recovery path.  The `Nothing -> root`
  fallback (line 119) preserves the solved-domain scope when no base mapping
  exists — this occurs only for nodes introduced during solving (not present
  in the original constraint), which correctly have no thesis ga′.

Conclusion: the binding-parent projection preserves ga′ for all nodes that
existed in the original constraint.  The `keepOld`/`keep first parent`
policies are safe because (a) redirects merge structurally equivalent nodes
sharing the same gen ancestor, and (b) the base-domain binding parents
(which define ga′) are computed independently of the solved-domain quotient.
